The basic assumption of DAD6 is an average Character attempting a fraught or difficult task. Of course, a Character may possess attributes (strength, agility, willpower, etc.) that are above, or below, this average, so how do we deal with that?

## Exceptional attributes add dice

For above average attributes, add dice to their dice pool equal to their attribute bonus.

## Poor attributes increase difficulty

For below average attributes, increase the difficulty for every two negative modifiers (ie. a -2 attribute modifier becomes a +1 Difficulty).

Why aren’t negative modifiers traded 1 for 1 into Difficulty? Added Difficulty swings the odds more than added dice so we’ve adjusted the scaling accordingly.
