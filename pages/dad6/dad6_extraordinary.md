Extraordinary tools, such as spell effects or magic items, at minimum add the value of their numerical bonus, if any, to the number of dice their wielder’s dice pool.

## Estimating the effect of a magic item or spell

If no bonus exists, estimate its effect as follows:

| Magic Item Power | Spell Level | Added Dice | Character Class Level Equivalent |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| Minor            | 1-2         | 1          | 1-3                              |
| Major            | 3-5         | 2          | 4-7                              |
| Legendary        | 6+          | 3          | 8+                               |

## Adjudicating abilities granted through magic

If an extraordinary tool would grant a Character an ability, power, or skill, add a bonus to their die rolls as if they had the appropriate skill bonus (see “[Adjusting for skills](dad6_skill.html)”) equal to the power of the item or the level of the spell. Note: *if you want to let high level casters flex, let them up-cast their spells to increase their effects!*
