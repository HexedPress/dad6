## A thief class

Use all the elements of the class as presented in your system of choice. Use this skill choice and progression in place of whatever the system provides.

### Progression

- **At first level**, the thief can choose three skills from the sample skill list above. They are considered Trained with each of those skills.
- **At fourth level**, the thief can choose two more skills to become Trained in; they become Expert in their original skills.
- **At eighth level**, the thief can choose two more skills to become Trained in; they become Master in their previously Expert skills and Expert in their previously Trained skills.

Whenever the thief attempts to use one of their skills, use the procedure as outlined in [The Basics](dad6s_basics.html) and in DAD6.

#### Level progression table

| Thief Level | Skills                                                                                                         |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1           | Choose any three skills; you are Trained in these skills.                                                      |
| 4           | You become Expert in your Trained skills; choose 2 more skills to be Trained.                                  |
| 8           | You become Master in your Expert skills and Expert in your Trained skills; choose 2 more skills to be Trained. |

### Alternate Progression

There’s no real limit to how to implement this skill system to construct (or reconstruct) the class of your choice. Here’s an alternate version of a thief progression that ends up in the same place (more or less) but with a bit more customization and more level by level progression:
