Character classes in *Troupe: Doomsday* are referred to as **Callings**.

## Baic Callings

There are four basic callings:

- [Bounder](troupe_doomsday_bounder.html), a wilderness-focused calling;
- [Delver](troupe_doomsday_delver.html), a dungeon-focused calling;
- [Sorcerer](troupe_doomsday_sorcerer.html), a magic-focused calling; and
- [Warrior](troupe_doomsday_warrior.html), a battle-focused calling.

### Edges and Talents

Each calling has an **Edge** and a **Talent**.

Edges
: Physical attributes that the calling is gifted with, such as strength or speed; when a Character uses their class's *edge* in a Challenge, they gain one die.

Talents
: A set of related crafts (skills) and lores (knowledge) that the calling excels at; when a Character uses their class's *talent* in a Challenge, they gain a bonus to all their dice.

## Level Progression

Callings progress through levels. With each level, a Character becomes more powerful and more skilled in their chosen field.
