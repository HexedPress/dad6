**Troupe** is a tabletop role-playing game based upon the [Do Anything D6](/index.html) framework. There are a few different flavors of Troupe, differentiated by the implied setting, rule variants, or both. However, all versions of Troupe share a common scaffolding, language, and mechanical basis, derived from [Do Anything D6](/index.html).
