Through Enchantment, a sorcerer manipulates the will and emotions of a creature through a verbal and physical performance.

{% include important.html content="A sorcerer must be able to interact with the creature and the creature must possess some sort of intelligence of at least an empathic level." type="primary" %}

For every HD of the creature targeted, add one to the spell's magnitude.

## Effects

Enchantment affects a creature's **demeanor** or **morale**.

| Rank | Demeanor    | Morale     |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------- |
| <3   | Belligerent | Routed     |
| 3-5  | Hostile     | Shaken     |
| 6-8  | Uncertain   | Steady     |
| 9-11 | Peaceful    | Confident  |
| >11  | Amicable    | Determined |

For each excess boon from the casting challenge, the sorcerer may move the creature's demeanor or morale by one rank, up or down. Additionally, at certain ranks, they may move the creature across thresholds to particular effects. **Minor effects** cost 1 boon. **Major effects** cost 2 boons.

### Demeanor effects

| Demeanor Treshold | Minor Effect | Major Effect |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| *Belligerent*     | Bloodlustful | Frenzied     |
| *Uncertain*       | Hesitant     | Held         |
| *Amicable*        | Fascinated   | Spellbound   |

Bloodlustful
: The creature attacks their nearest antagonist violently, with no care for their safety.

Fascinated
: The creature is beholden to the sorcerer and will respond positively to almost any suggestions.

Frenzied
: The creature attacks the nearest thing, regardless if it is friend or foe.

Held
: The creature is frozen in place; they cannot move nor act.

Hesitant
: The creature is slow to act; they act last in any challenge in which time is a factor and they lose 1 die from their dice pool.

Spellbound
: The creature's will is dominated by the sorcerer.

### Morale effects

| Morale Threshold | Minor Effect | Major Effect |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| *Routed*         | Fearful      | Daunted      |
| *Determined*     | Courageous   | Undaunted    |

Courageous
: The creature gains resistance against fear effects for the duration of the spell.

Daunted
: The creature must distance themselves as much as possible from the sorcerer; additionally, they will not attack the sorcerer, even to defend themselves.

Fearful
: The creature must distance themselves as much as possible from the sorcerer.

Undaunted
: The creature is immune to fear and morale effects for the duration of the spell.

## Duration

Unless otherwise noted, Enchantment spells are *quasi-permanent*. At the end of the spell's duration, the targeted creature may elect to try and overthrow the effect. They must succeed at a challenge of equal difficulty to the magnitude of the spell that they are under the effect of. In this case, any boons *explode*: they generate more dice that get rerolled until no more boons are generated.

If the attempt fails, the creature stays under the sway of the sorcerer for another cycle of time equal to the spell's duration.
