Elemental magic **manipulates** the four elements: **air**, **earth**, **fire**, and **water**.

{% include important.html content="A sorcerer must choose **one** of the four elements." type="primary" %}

## Effects

Elements can be expanded or contracted, their shapes altered, and their states affected, but <mark>they cannot be created or desroyed</mark>.

{% include note.html content="Fire can be *ignited* on a suitable, flammable host but this costs one magnitude, in addition to the [spell's spark](troupe_doomsday_magic_effects.html#the-spark)." %}

## Scope, Intensity, and Magnitude

The base magnitude for the spell is equal to [the distance to the effect and the spark](troupe_doomsday_magic_effects.html#calcuating-the-cost-of-a-spell-effect).

The scope of manipulation is determined by the excess boons generated through the spellcasting challenge. The more boons produced, the larger the scope, intensity, or [duration of the effect](troupe_doomsday_magic.html#spell-duration), at the discretion of the sorcerer.

To determine scope quickly...
: ...decide the number of *Mannes*[^1] that would be needed to duplicate or roughly represent a mundane version of the effect; a *Mann* is just a rough measure of one generic human person, in size, strength, or effort, as required; each Mann requires a boon.

To determine intensity...
: ...one boon adds one strain to the strength of the effect.

## Hinderances

The further away from its natural state an element is, the harder it is for the sorcerer to manipulate it.

- add one magnitude if the element has been worked (ie. masoned stone).
- add one magnitude if the element has been subjected to industry (ie. refined, smithed, or smelted).
