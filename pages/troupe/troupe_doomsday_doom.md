Doom Dice allow Characters to mitigate circumstances or accomplish special actions not normally possible.

## Earning Doom Dice

Characters earn doom dice by banking excess boons from successful [challenges](troupe_doomsday_challenges.html), by engaging with their [vices](troupe_doomsday_vices.html), or through other achievements at the Referee's discretion.

## Using Doom Dice

The following table lists some suggestions. Doom Dice are intended to be an open-ended resource. Talk to your referee and make a deal!

| Cost | Use |
| ---- | --- |
| 1 | Add 1 dice to the dice pool during a challenge |
| Equal to Character level | Defy death |
| 2 x Character level | Restore one weakened condition |
| Equal to incoming strain | Avoid strain |

Avoid strain
: Circumvent incoming strain from a single source; all or nothing-- must counter *all* the strain to prevent it.

Defy death
: Reduce a Character or Creature's dying state to weakened.
