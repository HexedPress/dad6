**Troupe: Doomsday** uses an ad-hoc magic system: there are no pre-written spells, spell slots, or spell points. Using magic works like any other [challenge](troupe_doomsday_challenges.html) in the game.

## Magic Concepts

At a high level, every spell that is attempted will have an **Effect**, **Duration**, and **Magnitude**. To minitgate the riks of spellcasting, sorcerers will often use **sympathetic components**.

Effect
: What the spell achieves. [Read more about spell effects](troupe_doomsday_magic_effects.html).

Duration
: How long the spell's effect lasts.

Magnitude
: The difficulty of the spell to cast, represented as a number; when casting a spell, the sorcerer must achieve as many boons in the casting challenge as this number.

Sympathetic components
: These are objects, reagents, and materials that help connect the sorcerer to the spell that they're casting; they should form a link between the caster and the effect, the effect and the effect's target, or between all three; the link can be physical, metaphorical, or symbolic.

### Spell duration

The longer a spell lasts, the higher the magnitude of the spell.

### Spell Magnitude

Through discussing the desired effect and duration of that effect, a final number is arrived at. The sorcerer must then complete a spellcasting challenge as many or more boons as this number.

## Casting spells

There are two different ways for a Character or Creature to invoke magic:

- Incantation
- Ritual

| Spellcasting Method | Casting Time | Effect Duration |
| ------------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| Incantion           | 1 exchange   | 1 exchange      |
| Ritual              | 1 turn       | 1 hour          |

### Incantation

The sorcerer performs the spell for 1 exchange.

- Double the performance time to increase the duration of the effect by one or reduce the strain cost by one.
- Double the magnitude to lengthen the spell duration from seconds to minutes or from minutes to hours.

### Ritual

The sorcerer performs the spell for 1 Expedition Turn.

- Double the performance time to increase the duration of the effect by one or reduce the strain cost by one.
- Double the magnitude to lengthen the spell duration from hours to days, from days to weeks, or from weeks to months.

## Magic schools

There are three schools of magic:

- [Elementalism](troupe_doomsday_magic_elemental.html)
- [Enchantment](troupe_doomsday_magic_enchantment.html)
- [Mimicry](troupe_doomsday_magic_mimicry.html)
