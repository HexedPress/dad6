Any harm, such as physical injury, or hindrance, such as exhaustion, generates strain.

## Types of Strain

<mark>There are three <em>grades</em> of strain.</mark> These grades don't define what they do (they all work exactly the same way) but the [time needed to recover from them](#relieving-strain). The grade is based upon the *activity*, *with a few exceptions based on special cases*, during which the strain was incurred:

| Activity                            | Strain Grade         |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Battle                              | Battle Strain        |
| Exploration actions                 | Exploration Strain   |
| Magic incantations                  | Exploration Strain   |
| Expedition actions                  | Travel Strain        |
| Magic ritual-casting                | Travel Strain        |
| Resisting effects (such as poisons) | Variable (see below) |

### Strain from resisting effects

When a Character may suffer an effect, such as from a spell or a Creature's power, the Player may choose for them to suffer strain instead. The amount of strain will depend upon the intensity of the effect. The *grade* of the strain depends upon the type of effect:

| Effect Type | Strain Grade       |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| Lethal      | Travel Strain      |
| Immediate   | Exploration Strain |
| Permanent   | Travel Strain      |
| Temporary   | Exploration Strain |

## Dealing with Strain

When a Character takes strain, they must invest enough of their HD to counter it. These HD are locked until the strain is resolved. If they take more strain than they have free HD, the Character becomes [Weakened](#becoming-weakened).

### Becoming Weakened

When a Character is weakened, all HD are lost; the strain infects the **Body** or **Mind** (player's choice).

With a strained body...
: A Character must divide their dice pool in half, rounding down, when attempting any *physical challenges*; normal physical tasks, at the discretion of the Referee, may become a challenge.

With a strained mind...
: A Character must divide their dice pool in half, rounding down, when attempting any *mental challenges*; normal mental tasks, at the discretion of the Referee, may become a challenge.

If a weakened Character becomes strained in both body & mind, any more strain causes [Dying](#dying).

### Dying

When a Character is dying, strain infects their **Spirit** and causes the onset of death. How quickly a Character succumbs depends upon the amount of strain affecting the Spirit, from days to hours to minutes to seconds to instant. While dying, a Character can still be [healed](#healing).

## Relieving Strain

Characters must recuperate to relieve strain by resting. There are three different types of rest. Any positive effects only occur when the rest is undisturbed and fully completed.

| Rest Type | Time                                 | Effect                                                                                                                                          | Uses                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Breather  | 1 exchange[^1] or 1 exploration turn | relieves all battle strain, 1 exploration strain[^2]                                                                                            | once per 6 exchanges/turns  |
| Slumber   | 2 expedition turns                   | relieves all battle & exploration strain, 1 expedition strain                                                                                   | once per 6 expedition turns |
| Respite   | 1 day                                | relieves all battle, exploration, & expedition strain, 1 travel strain, recover 1 weakened condition or spirit strain on a successful challenge | n/a                         |

[^1]: Must not be targeted or struck by any type of effect or be in melee with any Creature.

[^2]: If the breather is taken during battle, only recovers from battle strain.

Breather
: A quick rest; recovers from all battle strain; lasts 1 exchange or exploration turn; if taken for an exploration turn, also relieves 1 exploration strain.

Slumber
: A long rest; relieves all battle & exploration strain, 1 expedition strain; lasts 2 expedition turns.

Respite
: An extended rest; relieves all battle, exploration, & expedition strain, 1 travel strain; may recover 1 weakened condition or lasts 1 day.

## Healing

First-aid
: Anyone can attempt to provide **first-aid** during a breather; success adds the number of boons to the strain recovered for the subject but the aid-giver loses the benefits of the rest.

Surgery
: Anyone trained (see [DAD6 Skills](dad6s_basics.html)) in medicine can attempt surgery during a respite; it's a specialized challenge (see *DAD6 Skills*, "[Assessing challenge difficulty](dad6s_basics.html#assessing-challenge-difficulty)"); success adds the number of boons to the strain recovered for the subject but the aid-giver loses the benefits of the rest.
