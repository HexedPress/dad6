## Characters

Characters are represented by a **Calling**, **Level**, a **Virtue**, and a **Vice**.

Calling
: The Character's class, a set of Lores and Crafts that they excel at; [read more about Callings](troupe_doomsday_callings.html).

Level
: A measure of the Character's power; represented by a number, starting at 1; a Character has **Hero Dice** (HD) equal to their level.

Virtue
: An exalted source of motivation; [read more about Virtues](troupe_doomsday_virtues.html).

Vice
: A negative trait; [read more about Vices](troupe_doomsday_vices.html).

### Health

A Character's health is equal to their HD.

## Create a Character

Unless otherwise instructed by your Referee, your Character begins at level 1.

1. Choose your Character's [Calling](troupe_doomsday_callings.html); assuming you are using the core classes, you would choose one of:
   - [The Bounder](troupe_doomsday_bounder.html).
   - [The Delver](troupe_doomsday_delver.html).
   - [The Sorcerer](troupe_doomsday_sorcerer.html), or;
   - [The Warrior](troupe_doomsday_warrior.html).

   Each of the [Callings](troupe_doomsday_callings.html) has a *kit* that represents the equipment that they have on-hand when the game starts; roll 1d6 for which one your Character starts with.

   If you picked [The Sorcerer](troupe_doomsday_sorcerer.html), select their school of magic.

2. Choose your their [Virtue](troupe_doomsday_virtues.html).
3. Choose your their [Vice](troupe_doomsday_vice.html).
