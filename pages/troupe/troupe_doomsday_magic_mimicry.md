A Mimic sorcerer imitates the innate powers, ability, or form of creatures (hereafter called an *Aspects*) to their own ends.

## Mimicry requirements

A sorcerer must possess either a [Token](troupe_doomsday_magic_sympathetic.html#tokens) or a **Mark**, linking them to the Aspect that they wish to imitate.

## Marks of power

A Mark is a *magic scar* that a sorcerer suffers by surrendering themselves to the full effect of an Aspect that they wish to purloin for their own use. To gain a Mark:

1. The sorcerer must declare their intent at the beginning of an exchange.
2. They must suffer the effect of the Aspect wiout resisting.
3. They must survive and succeed at a challenge equal to the HD of the creature whose Aspect they covet.

### Benefits of a Mark

The benefit of a Mark is that, once acquired, the sorcerer no longer needs any components to summon forth the Aspect to imitate. They still, however, must succeed at the spellcasting challenge to succeed.

## Effect and Magnitude

The effect of the spell is the imitation of the desired creature's Aspect. For every HD of that creature, add 1 to the spell magnitude.
