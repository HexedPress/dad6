Every Character has a **Vice**.

## What is a Vice?

A **Vice** is a negative trait that, at the Player's option, can complicate a Character's circumstances. In practical terms, at the Referee's discretion, when a Character invokes their **Vice** to raise the stakes, add obstacles, or otherwise make a fraught situation harder to overcome, they lose 1 die from their dice pool in any [Challenge](troupe_doomsday_challenges.html) that arises but gain a [Doom Die](troupe_doomsday_doom.html).

## The four vices

Gluttony
: Overindulgence and over-consumption; the Glutton devastates the world to feed their insatiable hunger.

Lust
: Unbridled craving; the Lustful destroys anything in the path of their unbridled desire.

Vainglory
: Immoderately seeking renown; the Vainglorious will subjugate everything to the pursuit of their prestige.

Wrath
: Uncontrollable rage; the Wrathful destroy anything to placate their boundless anger.
