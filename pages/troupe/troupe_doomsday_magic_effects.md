## What is a spell effect?

The spell effect is the answer to the question: *what does this spell do?* The more complex the effect, the higher the magnitude of the spell.

## Calcuating the cost of a spell effect

To determine the cost of a spell effect, there are three aspects that must be considered: the **distance to the effect**, the **scope of the effect**, and the **spark**.

### Distance to the effect

*How far is the effect from the spellcaster?* Generally, the sorcer must be able to see the point where the spell effect will manifest; the further away this point, the higher the magnitude of the spell.

- contact: no change;
- close: +1 magnitude;
- near: +2 magnitude;
- far: +2 magnitude;
- distant: +3 magnitude.

### The scope of the effect

*How powerful is the effect?* The greater or more drastic the effect, the higher the spell magnitude. This will be determined by the nature of the effect and the [school of magic](troupe_doomsday_magic.html#magic-schools) being used by the sorcerer.

### The spark

The spark is the genesis of the magic effect; the manifestation of magical force. It has a fixed cost of 1 magnitude.
