The game is built onto the mechanics of the [Do Anything D6](dad6_overview.html) framework.

## Characters

Characters are represented by a **Calling**, **Level**, a **Virtue**, and a **Vice**.

Calling
: The Character's class, a set of lores and crafts that they excel at; [read more about Callings](troupe_doomsday_callings.html).

Level
: A measure of the Character's power; represented by a number, starting at 1.

Virtue
: An exalted source of motivation; [read more about Virtues](troupe_doomsday_virtues.html).

Vice
: A negative trait; [read more about Vices](troupe_doomsday_vices.html).

## Hero Dice and Hazard Dice

<mark>All die rolls use a d6 dice pool system</mark>. Characters have dice equal to their level. Thee are called **Hero Dice**. Any other entity that needs to roll dice use their **Hazard Dice**. Both of these are abbreviated as *HD* and they work in exactly the same way.

### HD are health

In addition to being the fuel that powers challenges, <mark>HD represents health or the ability to function</mark>.

## Challenges

[Challenges](troupe_doomsday_challenges.html) occur when Characters or Creatures need to roll dice to accomplish something fraught.

### Boons and Banes

When rolling dice in a [challenge](troupe_doomsday_challenges.html), <mark>results of six or more are boons</mark>. Score as many or more boons as the difficulty of a [challenge](troupe_doomsday_challenges.html) to pass. If the difficulty of the [challenge](troupe_doomsday_challenges.html) is not overcome, <mark>for every boon missing, a bane is created</mark>. Banes are consequences of failure.

## Strain

Any harm, such as physical injury, or hindrance, such as exhaustion, generates strain. [Read more about Strain](troupe_doomsday_strain.html).

## Doom Dice

**Doom Dice** are bonus dice that can be spent at any time for various effects; they're gained through banking excess boons from [challenges](troupe_doomsday_challenges.html) or from playing into vices. [Read more about Doom Dice](troupe_doomsday_doom.html).
