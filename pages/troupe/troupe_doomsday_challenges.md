Whenever a Character or Creature must contend with a fraught situation, the Referee may require them to **face the Challenge**.

## Facing Challenges

Facing a challenge means rolling dice to accomplish a goal; <mark>there should be stakes, constraints, and serious consequences of failure</mark>.

### Create a dice pool

1. Characters start with HD equal to their level, everything else uses their stated HD;
2. Add dice for **leverage** such as *teamwork*, *terrain*, *time*, or *tools*;
3. Add a die if they use their [Calling's edge](troupe_doomsday_callings.html#edges-and-talents);
4. Add a die of they play into their [virtue](troupe_doomsday_virtues.html);
5. Subtract a die if they play into their [vice](troupe_doomsday_vices.html) (but they earn a [Doom Die](troupe_doomsday_doom.html) for their trouble).

### Roll the dice

- Add a bonus to each die if they are using their [Calling's talent](troupe_doomsday_callings.html#edges-and-talents).

### Count the Boons

<mark>Results of 6 or more on a die are a boon.</mark>

- If there are as many or more boons than the difficulty, the challenge is won.
- If not, the challenge is lost and [banes must now be suffered](#suffer-banes).
- Excess boons can be carried over as [Doom Dice](troupe_doomsday_doom.html) or spent to buy down banes[^1].

### Suffer Banes

**Banes** are the consequences of failure. At the referee's discretion, a bane might be [strain](troupe_doomsday_strain.html), *collateral destruction*, *broken gear*, new *enemies*, or new *obstacles*[^2].
