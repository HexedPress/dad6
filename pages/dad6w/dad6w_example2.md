Let’s go back to _The Scorching Dunelands (_**_HD_**_4,_ **_T_**_4_ **_R_**_4_ **_A_**_1_ **_P_**_7_ **_S_**_4)_. An intrepid band of adventurers needs to locate a shrine somewhere in this brutal desert. It’s a search so we go with the Turbidity rating and set a Difficulty of 4.

## Combing the desert

There’s five Characters in the party, all Level 4, and they are all taking part in the search. They can roll their dice separately or pool them together. In either case, the party, as a whole, will end up with twenty dice and they need 4 boons. With a Ruggedness of 4, this attempted search will take the entire day (4 Expedition Turns).

They can exchange 16 of their dice for two boons, if they want, or roll all the dice and see what happens. Because this is a multi-stage challenge, if they aren’t successful in this attempt, they can try again, spending the standard amount of time but adding any boons previously earned.

Unfortunately, they have no clues, tools, or other means of adding to their dice pool but they do like their odds overall so they roll those 20d6 and end up with… two successes.

### Dealing with a baneful result

That leaves two banes. These banes might affect further attempts to find the shrine so the party decides to buy them off and convert them into two boons instead. The conversation settles on accepting two consequences: **Enemies close in** and **What is this new devilry?** (see DAD6, “[Sell Boons](index.html#sell-boons)” and “[What does failure look like]((index.html#what-does-failure-look-like)”). The first bane indicates that their adversary, who has been chasing them on this quest, is closing in on them. The second bane indicates that some other malevolent force has been awakened in or near the shrine— _maybe the party shouldn’t have been poking around where they don’t belong!_
