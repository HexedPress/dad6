Now that we’ve got some numbers, we can put them to work. For generic terrain, we can use [the table](dad6w_attributes.html#terrain-traps-summary-table), or another of our own devising, then grab quick values as needed to adjudicate actions. We can also create our own custom terrain with specific values that we deem appropriate. Let’s work out a quick example.

## The Scorching Dunelands

Let’s say we’ve got a particular area of desert that is comprised of towering sand dunes. We’ve got a name of the place, “The Scorching Dunelands” (it’s badass, I know.) We can start with a desert (HD 3, T3 R3 A3 P3 S3), modify it with hills (+1) to HD4, T4 R4 A4 P4 S4. We can stop there or we can modify things a bit more if we want. In this case, let’s say that we decide this region is REALLY dangerous but also VERY empty, so we raise its peril and lower its activity, to end up with a final set of values: _The Scorching Dunelands (_**_HD_**_4,_ **_T_**_4_ **_R_**_4_ **_A_**_1_ **_P_**_7_ **_S_**_4)_.
