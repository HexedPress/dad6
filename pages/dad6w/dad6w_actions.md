Expedition Actions represent the activities that a character or party will pursue while operating in the wilderness. These include: camping, foraging, hunting, searching, navigating, and traveling.

## Adjudicating Expedition Actions

Expedition Actions are adjudicated exactly as any other action using DAD6 with an added wrinkle: we’ll be increasing the challenge difficulty (see “[Increasing difficulties](dad6_increasing_difficulty.html)” in the core rules), depending upon the terrain’s environmental factors. What are those environmental factors? I’m glad you asked!
