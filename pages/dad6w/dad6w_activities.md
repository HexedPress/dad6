In DAD6, the “[Increasing challenge difficulties](dad6_increasing_difficulty.html)” section covers increasing challenges by levying a difficulty on attempts to complete them. An ordinary task has a Difficulty of 1, meaning that it requires one boon (a single success) to complete. If a task has a Difficulty of 3, it requires three boons to complete.

## TRAPS set challenge difficulty

Using TRAPS, the TRAPS or HD value becomes the default difficulty for Expedition Actions undertaken in that area. Navigating through a generic desert (**HD**3), for example, translates into a Difficulty 3 task.

**The time it takes to properly attempt an activity is equal to the area’s Ruggedness rating**. A Character can attempt to act more quickly but this increases the Difficulty Rating by the Ruggedness. If this seems harsh, remember that actions in the Wilderness take place across wide distances: a three-mile hex contains almost 8 square miles of territory to cover; a six-mile hex covers over thirty-one square miles!

## Expedition Actions are multi-stage challenges

Expedition Actions are, by their nature, multi-stage challenges (see DAD6, “[Multi-stage challenges](dad6_multi_stage.html)”). This means that tasks which fail can be tried again with any boons from previous attempts carried over. A Character can use successive tries to incrementally achieve a difficult task over time.
