It may or may not have occurred to you but Peril is a bit of an outlier attribute in that it doesn’t directly affect anything.

## Peril is a flexible measure of danger

Instead, it is a measure of overall danger that can be used in a multitude of ways, depending upon your needs. One way it might prove useful is in determining wandering creatures.

### A perilous example

Let’s say that, for _The Scorching Dunelands (_**_HD_**_4,_ **_T_**_4_ **_R_**_4_ **_A_**_1_ **_P_**_7_ **_S_**_4)_ area, we want to leverage a very simple, generic wandering creature table. Our table looks like this:

| 1d6 | Creature  |
| --- | --------- |
| 1   | Merchant  |
| 2   | Nomad     |
| 3   | Manticore |
| 4   | Giant     |
| 5   | Roc       |
| 6   | Dragon    |

We would normally roll 1d6, giving us an equal chance of any of the individual encounters. Using the area’s **Peril** rating, we can, in this case, roll _seven_ d6 and take the highest result. This gives us vanishingly small odds of rolling less than a 4 (but it’s still possible) and very high odds (just over 72%) for rolling the dragon. This is just one example of how you might use **Peril** at your table.
