**Troupe: Doomsday** is a minimalist dark fantasy tabletop role-playing game. The implied setting is a tumultuous era in an Arthurian-style land, during which the people are divided and hostile forces from Faerie strike at will.

> A great Gloom is come: the fences between worlds has faltered— faerie hosts from far Yonderlands sally forth with force, weaving rack and ruin in their wake; while diminished lords dawdle in despondent decadence, hem their sovereignties in with stone and steel, or succumb to war’s distractions over small-minded claims. It is to you to defend what you love, drive back would-be subjugators, or find profit in these troubled times.
