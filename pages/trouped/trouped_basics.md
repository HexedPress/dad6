The game is built onto the mechanics of the [Do Anything D6](dad6_overview.html) framework.

## Characters

Characters are represented by a [Calling](trouped_callings.html), **Level**, a **Virtue**, and a **Vice**.

Calling
: The Character's class, a set of Lores and Crafts that they excel at.

## Hero Dice and Hazard Dice

All die rolls use a **d6 dice pool system**. Characters have dice equal to their level. Thee are called **Hero Dice**. Any other entity that needs to roll dice use their **Hazard Dice**. Both of these are abbreviated as **HD** and they work in exactly the same way.

## Challenges

[Challenges](trouped_challenges.html) occur when Characters or Creatures need to roll dice to accomplish something fraught.

### Boons and Banes

When rolling dice in a [Challenge](trouped_challenges.html), results of six or more are **boons**. Score as many or more **boons** as the difficulty of a [Challenge](trouped_challenges.html) to pass. If the difficulty of the [Challenge](trouped_challenges.html) is not overcome, for every **boon** missing, a **bane** is created. **Banes** are consequences of failure.

## Doom Dice

**Doom Dice** are bonus dice that can be spent at any time to add dice to a dice pool; they're gained through banking excess **boons** from [Challenges](trouped_challenges.html) or from playing into Vices.

*[Lores]: Knowledge about a subject.

*[Crafts]: A set of skills.
