Character classes in *Troupe: Doomsday* are referred to as **Callings**.

## The core callings

There are three basic callings: [Bounder](trouped_bounder.html), [Delver](trouped_delver.html), [Sorcerer](trouped_sorcerer.html), and [Warrior](trouped_warrior.html).

### Edges and Talents

Each calling has an **edge** and a **talent**.

Edges
: Physical attributes that the calling is gifted with, such as strength or speed; when a Character uses their class's *edge* in a Challenge, they gain one die.

Talents
: a set of related crafts (skills) and lores (knowledge) that the calling excels at; when a Character uses their class's *talent* in a Challenge, they gain a bonus to all their dice.
