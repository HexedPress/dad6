Whenever a Character or Creature must contend with a fraught situation, the Referee may require them to **face the Challenge**.

## Facing Challenges

### Create a dice pool

1. Characters start with HD equal to their level, everything else uses their stated HD;
2. add dice for **leverage** such as *teamwork*, *terrain*, *time*, or *tools*;
3. add a die if they use their [Edge](trouped_callings.html#edges-and-talents);
4. add a die of they play into their virtue;
5. subtract a die if they play into their vice (but they earn a Doom Die for their trouble).

### Roll the dice

- Add a bonus to each die if they are using their talent.

### Count the boons

**Results of 6 or more on a die are a boon**.

- If there are as many or more **boons** than the difficulty, the **Challenge** is won.
- If not, the **Challenge** is lost and banes must now be suffered.
- Excess **boons** can be carried over as [Doom Dice](trouped_doom.html) or spent to buy down **banes**.

### Suffer banes

**Banes** are the consequences of failure. At the referee's discretion, a **bane** might be **strain**, *collateral destruction*, *broken gear*, new *enemies*, or new *obstacles*.

*[Edge]: An above-average physical attribute

*[HD]: Hero Dice / Hazard Dice
